def init():
    """
    Initialize or update the Groq API key and save it to a .env file.

    This function prompts the user to input their Groq API key, which is then
    saved to a `.env` file located in the same directory as the script. If the
    `.env` file does not exist, it will be created. This function also informs
    the user how to change their API key by calling this function again.

    Parameters
    ----------
    None

    Returns
    -------
    str
        The API key provided by the user.

    Notes
    -----
    The function prints a message indicating that the API key can be changed by
    calling the `init` function again. The API key is saved in the `.env` file
    with the key `GROQ_API`.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from Nara import init
    >>> api_key = init()
    Let Begin with Groq API (https://console.groq.com/keys): <user inputs API key>
    
    YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR API Calling init() :
